## Statement
Every integer greater than 1 can has a unique [[Prime Factorization|prime factorization]]
## Explanation
$$1200=2^4\times3^1\times5^2$$
The theorem states two things about this example:
1. Prime factorization of 1200 exists
2. No matter how the prime factorization is done, there will always be four 2's, one 3 and two 5's
